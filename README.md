# NamedPipes

Simple project for playing with .Net NamedPipes.

**SingleCallAndAnswer** shows exactly that. A client connecting to a server and sending a DataSet.  Server modifies DataSet and sends it back.

**AdHocPipedServer** shows a client, starting an executable server, then performing the same as in *SingleCallAndAnswer* but multiple times.
