# NamedPipes

Simple project for playing with .Net NamedPipes.

- Projects:
  - **SingleCallAndAnswer** shows exactly that. A client connecting to a server and sending a DataSet.  Server modifies DataSet and sends it back.
  - **AdHocPipedServer** shows a client, starting an executable *"server"*, then performing the same tasks as in the  *SingleCallAndAnswer* project, but multiple times.
